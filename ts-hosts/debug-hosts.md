# Debugging host health
{: #ts-hosts-debug}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} monitors the health of your hosts and tries to resolve issues automatically for you. For issues that cannot be resolved automatically, you can debug the hosts by reviewing the provided health information.
{: shortdesc}

1.  Review the health and status of your hosts. From the CLI, list your hosts in a location. From the console, click your location, and then click the **Hosts** tab.
    ```
    ibmcloud sat host ls --location <location_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:
    ```
    Name               ID                     State        Status   Cluster          Worker ID   Worker IP   
    satellite-test-1   aaaaa1a11aaaaaa111aa   assigned     -        infrastructure   -           -   
    ```
    {: screen}
2.  Review the states and the steps to resolve the issue in the following table.
3.  Check that your hosts still meet the [minimum requirements](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-host-reqs), such as for network connectivity. For example, if you change the firewall rules for the host machine's public or private network connectivity, you might make the host unsupported by blocking the necessary ports and IP addresses.
4.  If your host still has issues, try to [remove](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-hosts#host-remove), update, and [reattach the host](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-hosts#attach-hosts).

| Health state | Description
| --- | --- |
| `assigned` | The host is assigned to a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} resource, such as a location control plane or cluster. View the status for more information. If the status is `-`, the hosts did not complete the bootstrapping process to the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} resource. For hosts that you just assigned, wait an hour or so for the process to complete. If you still see the status, [log in to the host to continue debugging](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-ts-hosts-login).| 
| `provisioning` | The host is attached to the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location and is in the process of bootstrapping to become part of a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} resource, such as the worker node of a {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} cluster.|
| `ready` | The host is attached to the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location and ready to be [assigned to a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} resource](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-hosts#host-assign).|
| `normal` | The host is assigned to a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} resource, such as a location control plane or cluster, and ready for usage. |
| `reload-required` | The host is attached to the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location, but requires a reload before it can be assigned to a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} resource. For example, you might have deleted a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} cluster, and now all of the hosts from the cluster require a reload. To reload a host, you must [remove the host from the location](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-hosts#host-remove), reload the operating system in the underlying infrastructure provider, and [attach the host](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-hosts#attach-hosts) back to the location. |
| `unassigned` | The host is attached to the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location and ready to be [assigned to a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} resource](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-hosts#host-assign). If you tried to assign the host unsuccessfully, see [Cannot assign hosts to a cluster](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-assign-fails).|
| `unknown` | The health of the host is unknown. If the host is unassigned, try [assigning the host](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-hosts#host-assign) to a {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} resource, such as a cluster. If the host is assigned, try [debugging the health of the host](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-ts-hosts-debug). |
| `unresponsive` | The host did not check in with the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location control plane within the past 5 minutes. The host cannot be assigned when it is unresponsive. Try [debugging the health of the host](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-ts-hosts-debug), particularly the network connectivity. |
